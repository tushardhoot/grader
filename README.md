Grader is a simple grade management software for Windows, Mac, and Linux. 
It allows students to input assignments and the grades they received, and then to instantly see their current standing in the course.
They can add more courses, adjust grades to see hypothetical scenarios, or use it to compute what grade they need to pass.

Grader is built with C++ using Qt 4.8.
